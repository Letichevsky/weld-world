    TM Diva Oliva presents a wide range of olives and olive oil, an affordable Mediterranean delicacy, a tasty and healthy product. There are three major varieties of Greek olives like Green Halkidiki, Green Amfissa, and Kalamata, and Spanish olives like Gordal, Manzanilla, and Hojiblanca that are used in all of Diva Oliva olive products.

Table olive varieties are more difficult to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit. In some places in Spain and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines.

Regarding our oil, it is the product of the best olives from three European countries. The Ogliarola and Coratina varieties of Puglia come from Italy. The Arbequina and Hojiblanca varieties come from Spain. Finally, the Koroneiki variety comes from Greece, a very productive variety with great organoleptic qualities, whose ripening occurs from mid-November.

Perhaps, 100% natural unfiltered olive oil from Italy «il Paesano» by TM Diva Oliva, which literally means «country-side», deserves special attention. This is the best unfiltered olive oil, the recipe of which was passed down from generation to generation by one of the oldest families in Italy. In 2011, «Veld World» acquired the right to the formulation and production of unfiltered olive oil «il Paesano» by TM Diva Oliva. The olive pulp inherent in this oil gives it a unique taste and aroma, making it even more useful!

Also, Diva Oliva is not only the wine vinegar or the balsamic vinegar of Modena PGI. We also produce apple, balsamic glazes, tomato vinegar, fruit vinegar, vinaigrettes (with oil, vinegar and many other Mediterranean surprises), and other delicious vinegar and fruit-based condiments. Therefore, a wide assortment of TM Diva Oliva can satisfy the requests of the most demanding gourmet.
